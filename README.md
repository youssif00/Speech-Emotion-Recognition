Speech is the most convenient, easy, and natural way to express feelings and emotions. Emotion can be discriminated majorly by speech input. Emotions are crucial for humans, impacting perception and day-to-day activities such as communication and decision making. They are expressed through speech, facial expressions, gestures, and different non-verbal clues. Emotions are an integral part of human interactions and are significant factors in determining user satisfaction or customer opinion.
The main goal of the human interface is to recognize the users emotional state precisely, the recognition of emotional speech aims to identify the emotional condition of individual utterer by applying his/her voice automatically. Our speech emotion recognition model involves in depth analysis of the signal and identifying the appropriate emotion based on its trained database using extracted features.
